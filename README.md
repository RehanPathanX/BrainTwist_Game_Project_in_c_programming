 # BrainTwist Game

**BrainTwist** is a command-line-based game project developed in **C programming** using TurboC++. This project features two main games: the **Word Guessing Game** and the **Quiz Game**. Both games are designed to test the user's intelligence and knowledge in a fun and interactive way. The user interacts with the project through a neatly structured and attractive command-line interface (CLI), which includes a scoreboard and result tracking.

 ## About the Project

**BrainTwist** is an interactive project with two separate games that aim to challenge the user’s cognitive abilities:
1. **Word Guessing Game** – Where the player guesses words based on hints.
2. **Quiz Game** – A multiple-choice question game designed to test general knowledge.

The project is built with a command-line interface (CLI) that provides an engaging and structured experience for the player. Both games are accompanied by clear instructions and a well-organized scoreboard that tracks the user's performance. After completing each game, the user is shown a summary of their score, the correct and incorrect answers, and the option to replay or exit the program.
